# NLP Model Repository

## Description

Welcome to the NLP Model Repository! This repository contains a variety of models and techniques for natural language processing tasks, including hybrid models, classical machine learning, and word embedding techniques.

## Installation

To get started, follow these simple steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-model-repository.git

# Change into the repository directory
cd nlp-model-repository

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

The closing backticks on their own line indicate the end of the code block, and you can proceed with the rest of your README content.
